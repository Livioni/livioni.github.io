# 👨‍🎓 About Me

I'm a post-graduate student at  [Automation School](https://ac.bit.edu.cn/), [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/), and received B.Eng. degree from the [College of Information Science and Technology](https://en-cist.buct.edu.cn/main.htm), [Beijing University of Chemical Technology](https://english.buct.edu.cn/main.htm). As a member of the X-NS Group, I’m supervised by [A.P. Zhan Yufeng](https://ray-zhan.github.io/). My research interests include Video Analytics Systems, Multimedia Systems, and Edge Intelligence.

I am seeking a PhD opportunity (2025 Fall) in Beijing in the fields of Computer Vision or Computer Networks or System or Multimedia or something just like that. I aim to contribute innovative research and advancements in these dynamic areas.
